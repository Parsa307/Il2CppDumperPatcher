# Il2CppDumperPatcher
Patches Il2CppDumper to Support Il2CppDumper in Linux it would require the Source Code.
Copy the Il2CppDumper folder to the project.
I had this idea when I moddifed Il2CppDumper code to support Linux it was a simple patch I had done during my research I released Il2CppDumperLinux the reason I discontinued the project is to avoid legal issues cause i have changed the license and One contributor once requested me to update README.md via a Pull request which I agreed to but at the time I can't publish a new version so I had to remove the commits history and is annoying so I created this patch to avoid Updating Il2CppDumperLinux and also Il2CppDumperLinux was getting attention at one point and I got 3 stars which I appreciate your support.
